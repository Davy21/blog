    content: "Everyone has its own definition of sucesss. So do I !!! I think my success will be 
    based on how big the impact I can bring to the community, how much people I am able to help!
    As a software engineer, I like to come up with a new idea and make it as a side project for me. 
    I enjoy it so while thinking that it would change at least the community around me. But it is
    always harder than you think to achieve what you really wanted. People like to give up halfway ...
    ,get bored of the side project ... , overloaded with full-time job ... , of course, I feel it that way too.
    But, I will keep going. Somedays, it is going to be big."
